# Paint App

### Setup Instructions for running the application

`You are required to have npm version 18 to run this application`

```js
npm i -g pnpm
pnpm dev
```

### Overview

- Made a vanilla.js paint app under the directory src/paint-app [This can be looked as an hosted npm library]
- Wrote a container wrapper for paint-app in React, and also exposed required context, so that multiple versions instances of paint-app can coexist without collision in state
- Used the exposed React version for rendering and triggering updates on the paint-app
